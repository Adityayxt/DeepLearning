Data Usage Explanation

In this assignment, I did **not download the dataset from the internet during runtime**. Instead, I manually downloaded the dataset file (`cifar-10-python.tar.gz`) and placed it in the **same local directory** as the code files. This decision was made for the following reasons:

1. Reproducibility and Runtime Efficiency
   By using a local copy of the dataset, the code becomes more stable and efficient. It avoids repeated downloads and eliminates the risk of failures due to unstable internet connections during execution or grading.

2. Network Restrictions in China
   Due to internet access limitations in mainland China, it is often **difficult or impossible to download datasets directly from foreign-hosted URLs**, such as the one used by `tensorflow.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()`. Therefore, I downloaded the dataset manually and used the local file to ensure reliable access during development and grading.

3. Offline Execution for Grading 
   Storing the dataset locally allows the notebook to be run fully offline, making it more convenient for instructors or TAs to review without requiring internet access or modifying the code.

Original Dataset Source

The dataset used in this assignment is **CIFAR-10**,  It can be downloaded from the official website:

The dataset used in this assignment is identical to the official version and has not been altered in any way.
